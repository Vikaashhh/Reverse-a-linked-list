# 🗓️ Day 65 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔁 Problem: Reverse a Linked List
### 📌 Level: Easy
### 🧠 Key Concepts: Linked List Manipulation, Pointer Reversal
### 🏁 Status: Problem Solved Successfully

## 🎯 Objective:
Reverse a singly linked list in-place and return the new head pointer.
This is a classic data structure operation that lays the groundwork for advanced linked list algorithms.

## 💭 Approach Summary:
- Today’s approach focused on an iterative solution that utilized three essential pointers:

- Previous Node to hold the reversed list.

- Current Node being processed.

- Next Node to preserve traversal during pointer reversal.

- The transformation occurs in-place, ensuring optimal space efficiency without the need for auxiliary data structures.

## ✅ Output Achievements:
🔹 Test Cases Passed: 1115 / 1115

🔹 Accuracy: 100%

🔹 Attempts: 1 / 1

🔹 Time Taken: 0.58 sec

🔹 Points Scored: 2 / 2

## 📊 Complexity Insight:
- Time Complexity: O(n) – Linear traversal of the list.

- Space Complexity: O(1) – Constant space, in-place modification.

## 🔍 Why It Matters:
- Mastering this operation is essential because it serves as a prerequisite for:

- Detecting and removing loops.

- Checking for palindromes.

- Implementing complex data structure transformations.

- It’s not just about reversing pointers — it’s about restructuring logic.
